Belfort impresses his new boss with his aggressive pitching style, and earns a small fortune for the firm and himself. Belfort befriends Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill), a salesman living in the same apartment complex, and they go into business together along with his accountant parents and several friends. To cloak the fact the firm is a pump and dump scam, Belfort gives it the respectable name of Stratton Oakmont, shortly after which FBI Agent Patrick Denham (Kyle Chandler) begins investigating the firm.\n\nBelfort begins an affair with Naomi Lapaglia (Margot Robbie) resulting in his divorce from Teresa and a second marriage to Lapaglia, buying a mansion and a yacht that he names after her. They have a daughter, Skylar. At work, meanwhile, Belfort, Azoff and colleagues engage in non-stop debauchery and drug use.\n\nBelfort makes $22 million after securing the IPO of Steve Madden Ltd.

As the Quaaludes finally kick in with overwhelming effect, Belfort recklessly drives his Lamborghini back home to prevent Azoff from using his phone.

While Emma left the money to Belfort, he has to go to Switzerland the next day to sign for it. Over his grieving wife's objections, Belfort sails to Monaco when a violent storm capsizes their yacht. After their rescue, the plane sent to take them to Geneva is destroyed by a seagull flying into the engine, exploding and killing three people. Witnessing this, Belfort considers it a sign from God and decides to sober up.\n\nTwo years later, Denham arrests Belfort during the filming of an infomercial after Saurel tells the FBI everything. With  the evidence against him overwhelming, Belfort agrees to gather evidence on his colleagues in exchange for leniency.\n\nBelfort expresses optimism about his sentencing to his wife, who promptly informs him she will file for divorce, demanding full custody of their two children. Belfort throws a violent tantrum, gets high, and crashes his car in his driveway during an attempt to abscond with a frightened Skylar. The next morning, Belfort wears a wire to work, silently slipping Donnie a note warning him not to say anything incriminating. The note finds its way to Agent Denham, who arrests Belfort for breaching his cooperation deal; the FBI then raids and shuts down Stratton Oakmont.\n\nDespite the breach, Belfort receives a reduced sentence of 36 months in a minimum security federal prison in Nevada.
